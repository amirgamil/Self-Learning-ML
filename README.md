# Self-Learning-ML
A hitchhikers' guide to practical tips, motivation, and some of the best advice from the most distinguished people in the field all in one place.

I've been doing a lot of reading recently about how to get started in AI, which seems to be the question on everyone's mind. After crawling through hundreds of news of articles as procrastination (instead of actually working so I'll keep this brief), I've decided to create a list of resources I found with the best advice on how to get started. 

*Disclaimer, this is not conclusive and I will update it regularly as I find more stuff*

#On Getting Started
Start here:
1. [Top-down Approach](https://hackernoon.com/how-not-to-do-fast-ai-or-any-ml-mooc-3d34a7e0ab8c)
- Don't peak behind the curtain too early
2. [Apply first, unerstand theory second](https://twitter.com/EmilWallner/status/1184723559899418625)
- If you're learning a sport like baseball, do you pick up a bat and start swinging or open up a book on mechanics?
3. Start with one course (like [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/), [CS231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), [Machine Learning by Andrew NG](https://www.coursera.org/courses?query=machine%20learning%20andrew%20ng) or any [Chip's recommendations](https://huyenchip.com/2019/08/05/free-online-machine-learning-curriculum.html)  and **stop there**. Then open a jupyter notebook and start working on a project.

#On Building a Portfolio
1. [Work on something you're interested in](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-cold-start-problem-how-to-build-your-machine-learning-portfolio-6718b4ae83e9)
2. [Read, read, and read](https://github.com/rushter/data-science-blogs) to get [inspirtation](https://austinkleon.com/steal/).
3. Document everything you do on GitHub. [Here's why](https://huyenchip.com/2018/10/08/career-advice-recent-cs-graduates.html) and [here's how](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7r3gd4/how_to_efficiently_build_a_portfolio_on_github/)


#Some Cool Bonus Resources
1. [MIT's Deep Learning Course](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) which was launched this semester! They tackle some of the most recent and ongoing advancements in the field.
2. [Inspirtation for Projects](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/project.html)
3. [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) 
4. [The Godzilla of Libraries](https://arxiv.org/list/cs/recent)
5. [CS 229 Assignments](https://github.com/zhixuan-lin/cs229-ps-2018) which are not linked on their [website](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) but they just released their [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGwO_UgTS7I&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) for the 2018 iteration of the course
6. [Intuivtive explanations to papers](https://blog.acolyer.org/)

Now open a jupyter notebook and *let's start learning!*
